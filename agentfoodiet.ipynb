User Input Module\nCollects the following:\n- Preferred taste/flavor (e.g., spicy, savory, sweet)\n- Dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, halal, no peanuts)\n- Time of day (breakfast, lunch, dinner)\n- Current location (e.g., Bangsar)\n- Destination (optional, e.g., heading to Sunway)\n- Food type preference (optional: street food, café, healthy, quick bites)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Context-Aware Fetchers\n- **Weather API** (stub or simulated): Fetch current weather to influence food types (e.g., soup on rainy days).\n- **Time logic**: Suggest meals appropriate for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\n- **Place discovery module**:\n  - Simulated or real API (e.g., Google Maps, Foursquare)\n  - Suggest restaurants/hawkers near the current location or destination\n\n---\n\n### 3. LLM-Based Recommendation Engine\n- Uses prompt-based logic to generate recommendations from:\n  - User inputs\n  - Current weather\n  - Time of day\n  - Nearby food options (filtered list)\n- Outputs:\n  - **What to eat** (dish suggestion)\n  - **Where to eat** (restaurant/hawker name + location)\n  - **Explanation** (why this choice was made)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Simple Web UI (via Streamlit)\n- Web form to input preferences\n- Button to generate recommendation\n- Output area displaying:\n  - Dish recommendation\n  - Restaurant/hawker details (simulated or real)\n  - Map (optional or stub)\n  - Reasoning from LLM\n\n---\n\n## 🗂️ Suggested Project Structure (Kaggle-Compatible)\n\n```plaintext\n/AI-Food-Recommender\n│\n├── recommender_agent.ipynb         # Main notebook for simulation\n│\n├── data/\n│   ├── food_places_sample.csv      # Sample food places (manual or API-based)\n│   └── food_tags.csv               # Dishes with tags (diet, cuisine, etc.)\n│\n├── utils/\n│   ├── weather.py                  # Simulate or fetch weather\n│   ├── food_places.py              # Place lookup logic (API or static CSV)\n│   └── llm_agent.py                # Prompt template and response parsing\n│\n├── streamlit_app.py (optional)     # Streamlit app for local use\n└── README.md\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Dependencies (for Kaggle Notebook)\n\nYou can install external packages if needed (only if not already available on Kaggle):\n\n```python\n!pip install openai streamlit geopy requests\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Example User Scenario\n\n**Input**:\n- Preferences: Spicy, Halal\n- Time: Dinner\n- Location: Petaling Jaya\n- Destination: Subang Jaya\n- Weather: Rainy\n\n**AI Recommendation Output**:\n- **🍛 Dish**: Nasi Kukus Ayam Berempah\n- **📍 Place**: Warong Chef Mama, SS15 Subang\n- **💬 Reason**: \"Given the rainy evening and your preference for spicy halal food, Nasi Kukus is a warm, satisfying option. Warong Chef Mama is on your way and highly rated for this dish.\"\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Development Phases\n\n| Phase | Task |\n|-------|------|\n| 1 | Create user input form in notebook |\n| 2 | Mock weather + location data modules |\n| 3 | Build static food place CSVs (mock Foursquare/Maps API) |\n| 4 | Integrate LLM prompt system |\n| 5 | Simulate and display results |\n| 6 | (Optional) Streamlit version for local testing/demo |\n\n---\n\n## 📘 Notes\n\n- Kaggle doesn’t support Streamlit inside the notebook, but you can simulate all logic using standard input/output.\n- You may simulate location/weather APIs using preloaded JSON or CSV files.\n- For LLMs, use OpenAI API, HuggingFace, or simulate outputs if API access is limited.\n\n---","metadata":{}}]}
